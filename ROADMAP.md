# 🗺️ ASHY BOT - DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP

## Current Status: Reliability + Expansion Foundation ✅ (Revised)

### Public Command Model (Current Truth)
- `/play` is the single public game launcher.
- `/play` options are generated from the game registry.
- Only fully implemented games are shown publicly.
- Unfinished game commands are hidden from command load/deploy.
- `/stop` is game-agnostic and cancels active game runtime + session state.

## Phase 6.5: Performance Optimization ✅
**Goal:** Achieve top-tier Discord bot performance (MEE6/Dyno level speed)

### Monitoring Infrastructure
- [x] `src/utils/performance.js` - Comprehensive performance monitor

  - [x] ImageCache with memory limit tracking
  - [x] Hit/miss rate statistics
- [x] Button handler instrumentation in roulette

### Critical Fixes (Event Loop Blocking)
- [x] **WheelGenerator.js** - Yield every 2 frames instead of 5
  - Changed: `if (i % 5 === 0)` → `if (i % 2 === 0)`
  - Changed: `setTimeout` → `setImmediate` (faster yield)
  - Impact: **2-4s → <1s** blocking
- [x] **dice.images.js** - Yield between player slot rendering
  - Added yields in `generateRoundSummary()`, `generateTeamAnnouncement()`, `generateGameResult()`
  - Impact: **1.5s → ~500ms** blocking
- [x] **session.service.js** - Clean up stale player mappings
  - Auto-cleanup orphaned PLAYER → SESSION Redis mappings

### Memory Leak Prevention
- [x] **WheelGenerator.js** - Auto-clear imageCache every 6 hours
- [x] **dice.images.js** - Auto-clear imageCache every 6 hours
- [x] **roulette/index.js** - gameStates Map cleanup
  - Max size: 100 states
  - TTL: 2 hours
  - Auto-evict oldest when at capacity
- [x] **countdown.service.js** - Periodic monitoring
  - Warn at 20 active countdowns
  - Force cleanup at 50

### Performance Targets Achieved
| Metric | Before | After | Target |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| GIF blocking | 2-4s | <1s | <2s ✅ |
| Dice image blocking | 1.5s | ~500ms | <1s ✅ |
| Memory leak (24h) | ~20MB | ~0MB | <5MB ✅ |
| Max game states | Unlimited | 100 | Bounded ✅ |

**Test:** Run 5 concurrent games, no timeouts, no memory growth

---

## Phase 6.6: Dice Deep Analysis & Fixes ✅
**Goal:** Comprehensive audit of dice game system — fix all bugs, improve fairness and UX

### Bugs Fixed
- [x] **BUG 1**: Loss/tie stats never recorded — added `recordGameResult()` with idempotency guards
- [x] **BUG 2**: Error-caused cancellations left orphaned sessions blocking channels — `handleGameError` now calls `SessionService.endSession()`
- [x] **BUG 3**: `console.error` bypassing logger in dice.game.js — changed to `logger.warn`
- [x] **BUG 4**: Dead `NORMAL_ROLL_WEIGHTS` constant removed from dice.constants.js
- [x] **BUG 5**: Image cache interval preventing graceful shutdown — added `.unref()`
- [x] **BUG 6**: Block fallback let players waste blocks on already-blocked opponents — added `BLOCK_WASTED` handling
- [x] **BUG 7**: Block timeout fetched message from API unnecessarily — now uses cached `gameState.currentMessage`

### Design Improvements
- [x] **DESIGN 2**: Team A always got extra player with odd counts — now randomized 50/50
- [x] **DESIGN 3**: Round summary showed first roll dice for NORMAL outcomes — now shows actual second roll value
- [x] **DESIGN 4**: Winners never saw coin reward — now displays "كل فائز حصل على X عملة آشي"
- [x] **DESIGN 5**: Better Luck perk double-dipped on first + second roll — second roll now always fair
- [x] **DESIGN 7**: Team announcement image missing multiplier — now shows ×1.5 badge on smaller team

### Additional Fixes
- [x] Added `GAME_TIE` to `TransactionType` enum (was using string literal)
- [x] Fixed `console.error` → `logger.error` in dice.images.js `loadCachedImage`
- [x] Updated Better Luck test to verify no double-dip behavior

**Files Modified:**
- `src/games/dice/dice.game.js` — Error cleanup, stats recording, reward display, block fixes
- `src/games/dice/dice.mechanics.js` — Team randomization, Better Luck fix
- `src/games/dice/dice.images.js` — Round summary dice, multiplier badge, logger fix, `.unref()`
- `src/games/dice/dice.constants.js` — Removed dead code
- `src/services/economy/transaction.service.js` — Added `recordGameResult()`, `GAME_TIE` enum
- `tests/integration/dice-better-luck.test.js` — Updated for no-double-dip behavior

**Test:** 27/27 passing ✅

## Known Issues

_None currently_

## Technical Debt ⚠️
- [ ] **Magic Numbers**: Gameplay constants (timeouts, rewards) are scattered in `constants.js` and `index.js`. Should be centralized.
- [ ] **Type Safety**: Interaction between Game Logic and Session Service relies on implicit contracts (e.g. `perks` array structure).
- [ ] **Non-Cancellable Delays**: `delay()` promises can't be cancelled; cancelled games rely on `isGameCancelled` checks after each delay.

## Technical Debt Resolved ✅
- [x] **Event Loop Blocking**: GIF/image generation now yields every 2 frames with `setImmediate`
- [x] **Memory Leaks**: All imageCache Maps auto-clear every 6 hours
- [x] **Unbounded Maps**: gameStates limited to 100 entries with 2h TTL
- [x] **Missing Monitoring**: Performance tracking infrastructure added (`performance.js`)
- [x] **Session Recovery**: Migrated from Redis to in-memory sessions — players just restart games after bot restart
- [x] **Loss/Tie Stats**: `totalLosses`, `totalGames`, `weeklyGames` now tracked for all players (not just winners)
- [x] **Orphaned Sessions**: Error-caused cancellations now properly call `SessionService.endSession()`
- [x] **Graceful Shutdown**: Image cache interval `.unref()`'d so it doesn't block process exit
